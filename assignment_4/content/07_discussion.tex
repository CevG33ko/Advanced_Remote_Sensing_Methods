\section{Problem 4: Gradient Descent}
As is can seen in \ref{problem4_result} the result is very close to the actuall given line and fits very well.
Over all nearly 1000 iterations are calculated but the first 150 iterations have the most impact to the loss.
All further iterations still minimize the error but only with small effects.

These results are indicators for a very well fitting model to calculate the gradient and weights.
